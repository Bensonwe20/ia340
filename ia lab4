--4.7 -- Prompt: 
-- Write a SQL query to calculate the population growth rate of Virginia (VA) over the past five years. 
-- The growth rate should be calculated as the percentage increase from the population in the first year to the population in the most recent year.

-- SQL Code:
WITH population_data AS (   
SELECT    
  year,        
  population 
FROM   
  population_table
WHERE      
  state = 'VA'   
  AND year >= EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 5   
ORDER BY
  year )

SELECT
  ROUND( 
      100.0 * (MAX(population) - MIN(population)) / MIN(population),
      2 
    ) AS growth_rate_percentage FROM     population_data;








-- Comments:
-- I started with a prompt that asked for a simple percentage increase calculation. 
-- The initial SQL query might have required filtering the data to include only the past five years.
-- To ensure accuracy, I included a CTE (Common Table Expression) to filter and order the population data by year.
-- The final calculation determines the growth rate percentage based on the difference between the most recent and the earliest population figures.
-- No major modifications were needed; the approach seemed straightforward and effective. 
-- population was 0

/* no, it doesnt always produce accurate results becasue it is always trying to find the fastest way to write the code
